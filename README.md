# Locomotive Shopify Boilerplate
Shopify project starter based on [Modular Boilerplate]

## Installation
```sh
# install mbp and gulp
npm install mbp gulp@next -g
```

Until we make a gulp task for it, install [Shopify Theme Kit] to automatically upload files to Shopify.

## Usage
```sh
# init your project
mbp init locomotivemtl/shopify-boilerplate <directory>

# default watch task
gulp

# shopify watch
theme watch
```
