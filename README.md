# Locomotive Shopify Boilerplate
Shopify project starter based on [Modular Boilerplate]

## Installation
```sh
# install mbp and gulp
npm install mbp gulp@next -g
```

Until we make a gulp task for it, install [Shopify Theme Kit] to automatically upload files to Shopify.

## Usage
```sh
# init your project
git clone https://github.com/locomotivemtl/shopify-boilerplate my-project
cd my-project
mbp init

# default watch task
gulp

# shopify watch
theme watch
```
